### Tuts+ Tutorial: Creating Isometric Worlds - Primer for Game Developers (Updated)

#### Instructor: Juwal Bose

Isometric games have always provided a much immersive experience than the typical 2D games. Creating them can be a bit tricky at first, but once you learn your basics, it would become a much easier process. In this tutorial my aim is to unravel the mystery behind creating Isometric worlds & educate how to create simple Isometric world using the powerful [Phaser framework](https://phaser.io/).

There is a follow up tutorial which will add onto this and introduce more complicated aspects.

The original tutorial which was created in flash & actionscript can be found [here](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/creating-isometric-worlds-a-primer-for-game-developers--gamedev-6511).
